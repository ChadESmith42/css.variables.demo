# css.variables.demo
Demonstration project of using CSS variables

## CSS Variables
You can read all about CSS Variables on [W3Schools] (https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_variables.asp) or via [Mozilla Developer Network] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables). This project is just my exploration of the process and sharing my code.

## Javascript Functions
I added a "responsive" menu in *pure javascript*. While the code could be condensed and improved by using other libraries, this was my simple method of not injecting a ton of code dependencies.

## Also on [CodePen.io] (https://codepen.io/chadesmith42/pen/ZqoVNx)
You can see a working version of this code on CodePen.io (and many of my other projects).
